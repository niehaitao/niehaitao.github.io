# Simply-Re-Explained

> Who am I

*I've been Java Software Engineer for a decade then SRE since 2020.*

> What's the problem

*I find it hard to get started on a topic and often get lost in the world of SRE.*

> What's the solution

*Let's try to **simply re-explain** things like this:*

1. We start with each functional topic with an overview, the architecture comprising a bunch of components/tools.

   *See the [Monitoring Overview](sre-simply-re-explained/monitoring/README.md) for example*

2. Then we spotlight each component/tool on

   - how to install it
   - how to configure it for working with other components/tools of the stack
   - how to test it

    *See [Prometheus-Grafana-Loki Stacks](sre-simply-re-explained/tools/prometheus-grafana-loki/README.md) for example*
