# SRE Simply-Re-Explained

## Who am I

I've been Java Software Engineer for a decade and SRE 18 months.

## What's the problem

I find it hard to get started on a topic and often get lost in the world of SRE.

## How to resolve it

Let's try to demystify it like this:

1. We start with each functional topic with an overview, the architecture comprising a bunch of components/tools.
*(See the [Monitoring Overview](sre-simply-re-explained/monitoring/README.md) for example)*

1. Then we spotlight each component/tool on

- how to install it
- how to configure it for working with other components/tools of the stack
- how to test it

*See [Prometheus-Grafana-Loki Stacks](sre-simply-re-explained/tools/prometheus-grafana-loki/README.md) for example*
